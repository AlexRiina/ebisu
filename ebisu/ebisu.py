  `prior` is a tuple representing the prior distribution on recall probability
  after a specific unit of time has elapsed since this fact's last review.
  Specifically,  it's a 3-tuple, `(alpha, beta, t)` where `alpha` and `beta`
  parameterize a Beta distribution that is the prior on recall probability at
  time `t`.

  `tnow` is the *actual* time elapsed since this fact's most recent review.

  Optional keyword paramter `exact` makes the return value a probability, specifically, the expected recall probability `tnow` after the last review: a number between 0 and 1. If `exact` is false (the default), some calculations are skipped and the return value won't be a probability, but can still be compared against other values returned by this function. That is, if `predictRecall(prior1, tnow1, exact=True) < predictRecall(prior2, tnow2, exact=True)`, then it is guaranteed that `predictRecall(prior1, tnow1, exact=False) < predictRecall(prior2, tnow2, exact=False)`. The default is set to false for computational reasons.

  Optional keyword parameter `independent` is a precalculated number that is only dependent on `prior` and independent of `tnow`, allowing some computational speedup if cached ahead of time. It can be obtained with `ebisu.cacheIndependent`.

  See README for derivation.
